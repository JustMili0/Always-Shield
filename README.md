# AlwaysShield
Removes the obnoxious block delay of the shield, so it works the moment you press Right-Click. No more delay and confusion!

<hr>

## Why?
I was annoyed and tired of the fact that the shield in Minecraft has a delay before protecting that is _longer than the shield animation itself_.
So I made this, so I won't be bothered by it anymore.

## What does it do?
Always Shield completely drops the delay of the shield to 0, and that's literally all.

## How long will it be kept updated?
Until I'm 6 feet under. I love Minecraft _and_ programming, I ain't leaving no one without support. I'm planning to keep it updated for 1.21.1 Fabric and NeoForge up to 1.21.10, .11 and so on forever.

## Forge support?
**_No._** But you're free to port it if you want, you don't even need to ask me.

This is just a small QoL project I just wanted to make, so I don't really care to put much effort into the mod page for now. Maybe some day.

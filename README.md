# Always Shield
"How the #### did that hit me?" No more

<hr>

## Why?
In Minecraft, the delay before the shield starts actually protecting you is longer than the block animation itself. I've often seen people and myself be confused by how were they damaged despite their shield was up. I got fed up with it after learning about it and decided to code it myself.

And I do realize there's many mods like this one, but most are Fabric-only and aren't always up-to-date with the latest versions, and that's where Always Shield comes in with its support for 1.21 and above for Fabric, Forge and NeoForge.

### How long will this be kept updated?
Until I'm 2 meters under. I love Minecraft _and_ programming, so I'll keep updating the mod for however long I live.

### 1.20.1-1.20.6 support?
There will be at some point.

### Why does the mod version change, but there's no new content?
Just indicates state of the actual source code, gradle etc., but not the content of the mod itself.
